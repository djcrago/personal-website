              Hello! I&rsquo;m Dexter, a full stack software developer with a
              portfolio of 30+ websites and projects built from scratch,
              experience doing contract work for Outlier AI, and a strong
              commitment to continue learning and improving my skills as a
              developer.

          <p>
            The Odin Project provides a full stack web development curriculum.
            During that program I became able to confidently and independently
            build a full stack website from scratch using a variety of
            technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>Responsive Frontends: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js</li>
            <li>Backend Servers: Node.js, Express.js, and REST APIs</li>
            <li>Database Management: MongooseODM and MongoDB</li>
            <li>Authentication: Passport.js and JWT</li>
            <li>Other: Jest, Git, Webpack, VS Code, etc.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            Other aspects of my training included a strong foundation in
            programming fundamentals, code design principles, fundamental data
            structures and algorithms, and object-oriented design principles.
            Additionally, I developed an agile mindset and a practice of always
            writing clear, efficient, and maintainable code that follows
            industry best practices and coding standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            After my education I accepted contract work as a software engineer
            with Outlier AI, a company concerned with building generative AI
            models. Some of my tasks have included working on multiple projects
            evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, developing robust
            solutions to coding problems, coding to high functional and
            efficiency standards, testing and debugging coding solutions, and
            training others through a Slack channel. For example, one project
            included reviewing two code samples generated by an AI model,
            determining which code is better based on accuracy and efficiency,
            and returning my analysis to the model for it to learn from. In
            another project I did the same thing but instead analyzed the codeâ€™s
            style, it&rsquo;s readability and maintainability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before completing the Odin Project, I received my bachelor degree
            from Montana State University in science education. My education in
            logical thinking, the scientific method, how to learn and teach, and
            problem solving coincides with many aspects of software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>
              Taking large problems and breaking them down into smaller, more
              manageable pieces
            </li>
            <li>
              Brainstorming solutions to a problem and then testing, analyzing,
              and iterating on those solutions
            </li>
            <li>
              Communicating complex technical concepts to both technical and
              non-technical audiences
            </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of education I&rsquo;ve also gained a variety of skills
            through the various positions I&rsquo;ve held before like
            communcation, organization, and time-management. I also believe in
            taking ownership over my own work (both the successes and mistakes),
            maintaining professional standards of communication and work, and
            treating others with respect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, I enjoy hiking, pickleball and chess, have traveled
            the pacific northwest in a camper, and am passionate about
            volunteering with at-risk youth (below is a picture of me passing
            out water balloons to kids at a summer camp I volunteer at).
